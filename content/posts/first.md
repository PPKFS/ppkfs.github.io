Hello. I am Avery, more often going by PPK. I wanted to make somewhere more permanent for storing things so this is it.

The three major things I want to post about:

- **Roguelikes**
  - **A Haskell roguelike tutorial**. I really want to port some form of the excellent roguelike tutorials (e.g. [the original Python](https://rogueliketutorials.com/) one, or the [very thorough
    Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/) one) to Haskell with my libraries [`bearlibterminal-hs`](https://github.com/PPKFS/bearlibterminal-hs/) -
    a Haskell binding to [`BearLibTerminal`](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal) - and [`roguefunctor`](https://github.com/PPKFS/roguefunctor/) - a higher level
    wrapper around `bearlibterminal-hs` with more focus on roguelike style utility. I think that Haskell gets a bad rep of being unsuitable and difficult to make games
    and I would love to help dispel that.
  - **Maybe I'll actually make a game**. Which would mean wahey, devlogs. My motivation for writing this blog (well, more specifically trying again to write the tutorial) was after kind of losing motivation
    from the 7DRL jam. Not enough work on the libraries. However, I do have two ideas I'd love to work on - one is a `House` of Leaves fangame set in the world of *The Navidson Record* and the other is to expand upon my jam game - a murder mystery of some kind.
- **Yaifl**
  - A long time hobby project of mine has been some form of library similar to Inform 7. Currently this is [`yaifl`](https://github.com/ppkfs/yaifl), my interactive fiction library for Haskell. It mostly
    works and it's just lacking in fleshing out content (e.g. actions) and making it nicer to use. It's fairly straightforward to ignore the parser of the parser-based fiction and just use the rich semantics
    of a simulated world for other things.
- **Cocktails**
  - I like making nice drinks.
  - I did a single-elimination tournament to finally, once and for all, decide on my favourite drink. Some 40+ head-to-head drink matches later, I found the champion. I kind of want to write something up about it.
  - Probably some kind of aggregation of my original cocktail recipes.
